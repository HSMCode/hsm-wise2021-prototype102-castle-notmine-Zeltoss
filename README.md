## Code Overview
KieferController.cs controls the bugs mouth, it rotates the upper half of the head to look like a mouth being opened, if space is pressed

MunchController.cs controls the munching-process. If space is pressed, this script activates a collider thats part of the lower mouth-half
This collider is larger than it needs to be to make the game more playable. it is the trigger for apples to be eaten
MunchController also checks, if any apples that enter the foodCollider are good or bad, if they are good, this scripts adds points to the players score, if they are bad, it removes points
MunchController also has a part that enables the reloading of the scene via the press of a button and manages game-overs if the score is too low

AppleLauncher.cs simply launches the apples at a point out of view. It uses two coroutines to launch good and bad apples at random intervals.
Good apples are launched more frequently than bad ones. This is balanced out by bad apples subtracting more points from the score than good ones add

AppleController.cs makes the apples move. Once they are instatiated by AppleLauncher.cs, the recieve a small push in the direction of an invisible goal that is positioned to the left and out of bounds. If the space key is pressed, they are pushed towards the bug, if it isnÂ´t, they are pushed towards the left (towards the invisible goal)
If they leave the field of view, they are destroyed
If the enter the foodCollider while it is ective, they are also destroyed

GoodApple.cs has been deleted, its contents are used in some new existing scripts
